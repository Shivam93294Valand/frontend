To implement Option 1 (replacing the existing logo):

1. Create a new logo image with dimensions of approximately 40x40 pixels
2. Name the file "ic_logo.png"
3. Replace the existing file at "assets/images/ic_logo.png" with your new logo file

Your logo should:
- Have a transparent background if possible
- Be clearly visible against both light and dark backgrounds
- Represent your app's brand identity

After replacing the logo file, run the app again with:
flutter run -d YOUR_DEVICE_ID

No code changes are needed with this approach since the app is already configured to use this file path.
